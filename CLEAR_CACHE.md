# Cache Cleared

The `.next` cache has been cleared. 

## Next Steps:

1. **Stop the dev server** (if running) - Press `Ctrl+C`

2. **Restart the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. The error should be resolved now.

## If error persists:

1. Clear all caches:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   ```

2. Restart dev server

The old MySQL connection files have been removed and all imports have been cleaned up.
